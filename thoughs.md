#What's next?#
many though fly into my mind about what should i next and how, my knowledge in javascript grows more and more as my hunger for them does

It's been a while since i decided to make a big change in my life and i actually put some work into it

Was it easy? 
Not in the begining, it seems like as soon as you start to progress with your projects you get more creative with excuses

What's going on now?
today i finish the first part of a very cool project which i came up with i didn't see a thing about it anywhere

What's next?
i'm looking foward new projects that challenge me to learn more so i stop walking little steps and start running into my adventure

## I'm done studying, it's time to learn ##
