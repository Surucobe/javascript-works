# What's next? #
### 12/07/2019 
many thoughs fly into my mind about what should i next and how, my knowledge in javascript grows more and more as my hunger for them does

It's been a while since i decided to make a big change in my life and i actually put some work into it

Was it easy? 
Not in the begining, it seems like as soon as you start to progress with your projects you get more creative with excuses

What's going on now?
today i finish the first part of a very cool project which i came up with i didn't see a thing about it anywhere

Now what?
i'm looking foward new projects that challenge me to learn more so i stop walking little steps and start running into my adventure

### 13/07/2019 
Today i had my first peek into actual dinamic content, they way to make automatic content, content that updates automatically as soon as someone request it and it may change depending on who and when it is require

how did it went?
i'm still absorbing this and i won't be able to properly say i know how to do it till i implement it on my projects

the first question it's, how am i gonna do that?
well actually there is a very simple answer, i got an idea i wanna generate a dinamic list that changes as soon as the user puts some info into the array, i only saw how to with content that was already there but i don't think it changes that much maybe just on how they interact

### 14/07/2019 
today i worked really hard i must say, i worked with dinamic content generated by the user in my projected, the poke projected, i keep telling myself "i'm not going to do some kind of silly victory pose if this works" and then 2 seconds later after i test and see the succesfull result, there i am making a silly victory pose lol

how did it went?
it went really well, at first i struggle generating the html that would held my dinamic content as it was suppose to bring an image an some text but it only bring the image, after fixing the html i manage to bring both images and text with no problem all that is left is for me to learn how to make it go away or refresh

do i know how to do it? not yet, do i have an idea? a minor one, is it a good idea? hell no! but you know what? i get to have fun while doing so i feel closer to my goal

### 14/07/2019 
funny story, as i was working on the javscript file today i forgot that in order to work with an external api once the app is deployed i need to work on the cross origin for my app to work, i forgot to do that and i'm not sure how to do it just yet, so after a succesfull deploy of the web site with a fail app i went back to the code and seem that i delete something by mistake so my idea was, let me just go to my previous commit where everything is awesome! yeah....

What Happened?
well i was in a detached head of the commit and i forgot to see and keep working and ended up saving all the progress in there, yeah i know there is a way to move that commit but... i just remember that, in any case i had to add some of the changes i did to the master branch manually

Did i learn something?
yeah... the implementation of a hotfix branch is key for me to not loose my mind and keep workin, on a side note i learn how to remove the implemented html from javascript with more javascript! my app is starting to take shape

### 15/07/2019
i'm writing the 15/07/2019 log on the day after, 16/07, due to a internet problem from yesterday that basically leave me with no internet till 12:35 from today 16, lucky me i manage to work on my projects before this happened

What did i do?
i working on a replacement for the sweet alert library i was using on my app, creating my own modal which will make everything sweet alert was doing AND more as i'm planning on replacing the propmt i'm using to catch the user request , this part should be easy the, ironically, hard part is the visual part i wish to add, right now the modal remain with some static elements but son enough it will be completely independant of these

### 16/07/2019 
so.... the part i said was easy? yeah i don't wanna talk about that, let's just say i have a new respect on how prompt works, as i'm stil working on this new subject i learn that storing multiples answer in a single array to replace what's gonna be shown is a very comfortable practice, unlike what it looks like

what did i do?
not the propmt that what.... i keep making progress into a more dinamic app by aming to make a completely dinamic modal which will be basically empty, except for a button, till you hit a button i also learn you can work with multiple background, i've been thinking about storing all the string i have for javascript to build into a big array but i don't think is a good idea, at least not inside an array

### 17/07/2019 
Today i'm making this early, i usually write my progress at the end of the day before i go to sleep but today is different, i'm planning on going to sleep early as i'm currently sick and i need to take care of myself and my brilliant ideas, i believe is the first time i say that with no irony nor any sarcasm.... at least not too much

am i feeling ok?
not quite, beyond my sickness i'm worried about my laptop, it's not on it's best shape and i have no currency, money, tradeble chickens, or any kind of money i can use to buy a new one all i got is a goal of having a very good job that allows me to buy one some day

was there any progress today?
uhm.... yeah i made the error message of the modal completely dinamic, there is something else i wanna to implement still but idk how to do it just yet, give me some time and i did learn that you cannot get a dinamic id from an element but then again i'm still learning, idk how to explain this but i recently feel like a whole new world just open it's gates for me...

## 18/07/2019 ##
today i started to see dinamic forms which is interesting and changes the way i'm looking at how to keep building my app, it seems easier in a way, yeah i'm trying to avoid creating the popmt i know BUT i also need to practice this sort of things so....

today was short....
yeah i got unexpected company so i need to finish early today but i have no excuse for tomorrow

i'm feeling better by tthe wway!

### 19/07/2019 
today i start working with a new idea, instead of summoning a propmt into my app to take the users' input, work with an actual input printed in my html in order to well firstly try something new, working with a form in javascript, and making my app visual part on the website better by being able to work with an element i can customize.... NO, i'm not avoiding the propmt!

how did that go?
terrible i know squat about making form from jsvascript, i barely manage to get the input data in a const at the end of the day AND i can't help to feel fucking amazing for it! it was challenging it was new and at the end i manage to get my object in answer to my input and even tho i don't have this new branch incorporated and working on the master branch is exciting to try something new, i don't understand this new methods YET, but i will soon, give me an actual day to sit, read and practice i still need to improve some minor and some other major things, but my future projects will be gratefull i took my time learning

P.S Future me, if you are reading this and you are being an ass, remember that people is just scared of being judge they are scared of being nice to people and people not being nice to them, give them time

### 20/07/2019 
so today i kept working on the form and made it work! end of today's log!

what's that really all?
ok no but it's really all that i did, well i did learn that using a propmt in different from the input when it comes to getting the users input, you see, it seems that the propmt stores the value while the input just hold it as it is submit, is quite different giving me the awkward result of the modal showing up empty white while my code gets the information, javascript asynchronism, so in order to manage that a little better i decided to just tell the code to wait and it does work on the most part, i need to make the code to wait for the image to load before showing the modal but i think is time to move into the styles and maybe another project

### 21/07/2019
today i decided to chill and take a nice brake, play some cards, watch some anime, eat good and play with my dog, i did try checking some algorythm in freecodecamp cahllenge, it was fun and made think also started the first part of a new repo which will contain my ULTIMATE portfolio

why the caps?
i wanted to give like a big stounding sense, like saying "yup, this one is gonna be my greates project so far!"the reason why is cause my knowledge in javascript is better now, even if it's not completed yet, and also cause i need to keep moving i can't just stay studying and saying "yeah i'm learning" i need to put that knowledge into work, oh also i move my local repo somewhere else

## 22/07/2019
today i started working on my portfolio, i decided to put a pause on my poke app and start moving on with my protfolio whit a cool picture of a couple of hardworking stormtrooper

what happened?
there was a massive blackout in my country.... no energy till around 1 or 2 am maybe and then around 4 am light was off again, internet hasn't come back ever since and all i did was the side bar and the main page so yeah there is that

##23/07/2019
energy finally came back like 1 or two hours ago, it's 14:17pm at the time i write this down and while i work on my portfolio

why so early?
i don't know if there will be energy later... there's no warranty i won't spend another 12 hours with no energy so i wanted to be a little proactive and work on my projects... nope internet is still gone so i haven't been able to update my github, it only hurts the fact that my cute activity summary on github is gonna have a few gray squares but that's actually the least of my problems right? if you wonder how it feels like to be in the pitch dark for so long, it's like boxing blindfolded you are not even sure who are you fighting, how many are you fighting or if you are even fighting time even pass slower, huh!

i won't give up, it takes more than this to make me quit, actually there's nothing that can make me quit now!

##24/07/2019
give me a moment i was laughing....

better now?
is important to keep a healthy mind one that can be a flow of unlimited ideas and plans and what a better way to do that than laughing, after every lesson and sometimes while i code i put on some funny videos to have a nice laugh andit feel amazing! i mean my mouth hurts but for a good reason 

what about the projects?
i'm giving a rest to the main project i was working on till i get some new ideas to add and in the meanwhile i started working on my portfolio, this will be my best work yet, the goal is to make an incredible personal website aiming to show anyone who enters in this one who am i and what can he expect from me if he hires me, i'm moving on my projects but still need to get back to some other stuff, i'm glad i have many things to do!

##25/07/2019
apparently i kinda miss a day, i've been coding every single day, some less than other, but every day but i guess that in this madness i'm living in i miss a day due to energy problems

how you doing?
i'm going well, today i keep working to imrpove my app making sure that once an object is already inside of an array a second object won't go inside the problem may be the fact that i used a second array to evaluate this, the second option would be to evaluate a single array and work on a function to take out the id of those objects to tranforms them into objects again soon in the app but sounds like lots more of code and making new petitions and sounds longer and not quite efficience, may look for a different solution soon tho, a new idea pop into my head, creat the ultimate catalog with ALL the pokemons and IT IS madness but i like how it sounds

##26/07/2019
today was an interesting day, i improve my app and check some new things on my classes i feel glad to understand everything i do, and even when i get a little lost i can just start reading what i'm doing

what's next now?
many ideas and thoughs run through my head wildly, idk how to make most of them and i'm not sure how to make the other but i yet but i know is possible and i just need some time, i've been thinking about trying the 100 days of code challenge again, i mean i'm already on it on my own but this time i would like to finish this

##27/07/2019
today i had a very productive day, i started a new class in OOP, oriented object programming i know the name better in spanish, with the goal of understanding objects and classes a little bit better and a new though pop into my head i feel like my life has change a lot in these last few weeks i've made some major changes and i'm looking forward to keep making more and more changes, i'm still looking in my ultimate goal but i feel like i'm stuck...

why you feel stuck?
well when i first start programming, making cool stuff, making this kind of things that i've never done before in my life i feel so different, like if i was a new person a different one but this feeling lasted little i can still make new a cool stuff and every day i learn more and more but i feel like i'm stuck with new trick under the same categories i wanna keep moving forwards i want new challenges and for that i most keep practicing and learning but then the question pops into my head, how do i get to the thngs i wanna do, where do i find them but i think there is right answer i just need to keep walking and hope to find all those answers on my own... yeah

##28/07/2019
today was a very normal day, i decided to take an actual rest, no classes, no reading about classes, i basically slept eat and eatch some videos

what's that really all?
well i also work on my projects and may or may not look at them again before i go to sleep, i may also look for a few things about js before going to sleep i have a few ideas in my head that idk how to execute just yet but that i'm sure i will execute and are gonna be great, today i linked working on my portfolio more than i like to work on my other projects

##29/07/2019
I spend most of the day trying to make my repo in github works, the one that works with an api, but i couldn't make it worh it to me because me but it seems that github has is own rules about this kind of things

long day?
i guess you could say that, i fall asleep and ended up writing this the day after i made a huge mess with my personal things and my studies, i try to make both things happened and ended up doing none i need to set what i'm doing better, stick to one things after the other, i wanna finish my projects which will only be finish if i keep working on it and i wanna keep working on my portfolio but i need to stop being scared from moving on for this

##30/07/2019
finally manage to work with the localstorage now the next step is working with the elements i creat at the moment so that part will be intereting, i already have an idea

that's great!
it is!!! i wanna keepp working on new thing, such as the portfolio what i already said a new project and how to make it work in this repo or maybe somewhere else, the idea is to maybe show my work!

##31/07/2019
spend the entire day on a way to interact with the elements i was printing on my code, it was hard and it makes me realize that i still have a long way to go, but i'm enjoying it, i still do small and funny celebration stance whenever i achieve something in my code, i can't help it

you moving?
maybe... i've decided to give 100 days of codes a second chance, well rather look for a second chance on a 100 days of code i didn't finish that challenge and i'm no coward, i'm done running and have no interested in doing so ever again so here i am once again but stronger this time

##01/08/2019
quick though in a couple of week it wil be a month since i started doing this log, is nice, i once heard that to make something an habit you need to repeat it every day for a month, i found myself in piece doing this,i like to share my ideas with... me lol and next month will be my birthday

new plans?
well before my birthday arrives i would like to get a nice paid job as a fronted developer so i can actually celebrate or who knows maybe even buy a phone! that would be very sweet to FINALLY have a phone means i would get to talk with my friends again

what about coding?
i feel stuck but at the same time i feel like i'm not, i'm looking for way to implement new stuff on my app, what i'm doing it may be advanced and idk how to do it but i like it, i'm trying to either make an element appear every time i place the mouse on certain areas or to make an element be created at the moment i place the mouse on those areas

##02/08/2019
today i didn't code that much, i solve some freecodecamp problems and saw some classes on webpack and OOP it was nice

out of ideas?
not really i still have many i just don't know how to plasm them into the web i also wanna start studying for interviews and want to study react.js there is a lot of things i want to study but before i do that i also wanna work on my concentration

##03/08/2019
today was normal, i'm still coding as i write this i'm gonna work on my portfolio but i didn't study that much, i'm currently studying objects so i can understand js objects a little bit better

objects huh?
yeah i need to learn and dominate objects i cannot let myself get stuck can i? besides if i learn objects things will have a new and different perspective that i'm looking forward, also today i sent my cv to a company looking for a web developer idk if i will get it but i feel like i'm already making changes is the first time i apply for a company as a web developer! this is exciting

##04/08/2019
today i'm making this one form my visual studio code idk why i just felt like doing so, thse ays have been rough i don't feel that motivated, i must be doing something wrong, ideas are still flying by but other things seem to be getting me down as i type this  feel like crying even tho i have no reasons... well maybe i do but crying won't fix a damn thing

is it affecting your code?
maybe, again i have no idea about this cause... maybe i just need to talk to people, ever since i lost my phone y feel like i lost my friends, i can still talk to them but not like before, they are no longer one text away from me i can now notice the distance between us, today i'm not talking about code but not every day has to be about it yea i'll be good once i work over this things

##05/08/2019
today was a very normal day, i can barely type this cuase.... i fell asleep and forgot to this before doing so and so i'm half asleep yay

half asleep?
yeah but today was a day of improvements as i started making some fun changes into my app in js, also learned how to make classes in Java and Python, i feel like i'm no longer stuck but i need to focus more on what i was doing!
Also with this commiy, this will be the commit 100 of this repo, so hurray!

##06/08/2019
today was officially my laziest day EVER!

that much?
yeah i mean i just study and well yeah i know i study but still i did not study much, i'm not complaining tho, maybe the problem is that i don't enjoy myself and i tend to do the things in a different way, like for example, coding as much as i can although i do get to enjoy that but forcing myself into it is bad

##07/08/2019
it's been a while since i had to write yesterday's progress today but well i have no controlover this part at the curent moment i'm afraid, having family over means i have to go to sleep when they do but i keep coding

what you coding?
i'm currently studying and practicing with webpack... more studying than practicing tho, but it has been fun and usefull to see this course thanks to the fact that is nt just webpack but it also shows hw it works with js and having multiple html and js documents working together and with only one css which is amazing if you ask me! on a side note i feel like playing with java

##08/08/2019
as family visits continues i have been studying less, tomorrow i'll go to a friends house and stay so i may do some actual code there, i have some fun ideas to do but i'm also downloading other cool stuff to do

what ideas?
well i've been thinking about a fun license creator, it will be a form that will take information from people and make a license of whatever they want such as a license for whispering corndogs or a license to kill or a license to check if people says the letter K properly lol, only valid in neverland for law reasons, i wanna keep expanding all the things i do

##09/08/2019
today was a cool day, i rpove that there are things that i don't know yet even if i saw them in classes but that i can still manage to make it

that's cool!
it's freaking amazing!!! i mean i have new ideas and i want to implement new stuff, the kind of stuff that you wish to make without knowing what is gonna happen lol, i have an amazing function that rotates picture, name and id of the pokemons but is not working as i though it was, is working but not in the way i though i need to check it better to make sure it does as i meant to

##10/08/2019
i decided to go out to meet some friends thinking i could update everything there but turned out that there was no internet so now there is a little gray square in my github history... rip

laughing out loud?
i guess, the idea of making everything from js is tempting, making the html content i feel like practicing this new technique or rather just practice this tecnique as much as i can this is a nice way to improve what i know

##11/08/2019
so.... apparentely so much time out of my routine got me a little rusty, it was hard for me to get into a routine where i work on my projects and study while not getting any of my other duties off and as a result it seems i'm a little off of my schedule

how come?
i feel like i'm coming back from vacations i still work on my projects but i get a little lazy but i'm reignited!

##12/08/2019
a new day begun and it seems like my ideas are also coming back from vacations but i'm not gonna allow myself to be lazy about this!

longer explanation?
well i feel like if i allow myself to be lazy i'll just stop looking to improve but at the same time i must be aware that i need to take a proper rest every now and then, not just a "i'm lazy to study or code right now" kind of rest but more like "i'm gonna go outside walk for a while and let the sun hit me for a change" kind of rest lol and after saying this i can also proudly say that i finish the basic algorithm section of freeCodeCamp, some of these were difficult and the other a bit confusing but they surely were fun :D

Also i've been updating this log for a month already, except for a sad day with no internet where i couldn't so gratz me!

##13/08/2019
i swear idk how i am awake, maybe is the wish to keep doing other stuff or the fact that i'm downloading a program, or the feeling of my innevitable responsability on taking my dog out for a walk tomorrow despite of the fact that i'm still sleepy...

coding?
today i code very little i made some classes on Java and Javascript and fight with php... i don't like php but is more of a personal matter than an actual reason i prefer javascript but php is needed in projects and some companies so i have to study to keep learning and improving

##14/08/2019
today was a nice day, i study object i solve some minor troubles on my vs code configuration for Java and even tho i didn't solve PHP i still keep it in mind, i may solve it later

and what else?
well i keep studying the object part from freeCodeCamp, idk yet if it's just hard or my english is just stopping me from getting a full understanding of this subject but is gonna be a little rough, and while i do this i'm also studying OOP on Platzi where i happen to understand better lol

##15/08/2019
another day studying objects and doing exercise which i found funny enough btw

how come?
i've been studying objects with Java, JavaScript, Python and PHP the syntax between them is very similar yet is interesting, Java is a language more focus into programming and not so much web, not sure if it's possible to use it in web due to my lack of knowledge, and as i keep studying the langeague and how to make objects Java seem more and more attractive i think i may study this language in the future for sure!

##16/08/2019
this day i was overwelhemed by the decisition of what should i next, i see a lot of people asking for php while some other asking for react, i've come to realize that maybe i need them both and have to learn them, it feels complicated and quite unfair as it seems my path is taking a forcefull and difficult detour

how you feeling?
not so great, i'm a little scared as i'm facing something new that i've never done before, i have the goal of getting a job as a web developer before september 25, most of the offers seem to look for someone who knows php a language i don't find myself too fond with but there are some other who look for react, the next step into my evolution in this career in any case i need to work towards this with the desire and determination to improve myself and be one step closer from my ultimate goal

##17/08/2019
today i just chill, there wasn't so much coding just me learning some object oriented programming in freeCodeCamp and checkin my notes from Platzi

how did it go?
kinda nice i start a new project a little ago is not that fancy yet tbh but in time it will be fun, nowhere near as fun as the poke project for sure but still nice hahaha also kept studying the object section from freeCodeCamp i feel is a little outdated due to the fact that they explain the objects using prototypes which is not that bad... but since ES6 already supports classes i see no reason to feel particulary excited about using prototype.... except maybe the fact of looking at how it used to be other than that i feel like reading history...

##18/08/2019
this weekend was soft on conding but me  being sick is getting me bad, today's entry is gonna be short due to that and this is gonna be it actually

##19/08/2019
today i kept studying OOP, i need to work hard on this

why?
the reasong is quite simple, object programming is the main focus and source of all kind of programs now a days, well there are some codes that still remain structured but this is the most efficience way to work on it makes things simplier and more fun and interesting... is how video games are made and so i need to work hard on this cause is the way i will learn this, that's how i did with javascript and as i'm still learning i need to continue

##21/08/2019
today i'm feeling quite tired so this entry may be a little short

or is it!?
as i started my new project i realize what i need and what i got, i started with a simple idea which quickly improve as i was progressing with this logic, my first task is simple, create an objest that listens to what i'm doing on the keyboard, the following part will be difficult, moving this object... i remember doing so a long time ago with a canvas maybe i should check that option again

##22/08/2019
was an average day, struggle with my new project realizing i need to study more object oriented programming, specially in JS

that bad?
most of the resources i already have are quite old sadly... which means some of them are even focus on teaching objects with prototypes and what i really need is to learn how to use this along with my objects in order for me to be able to work this trhough and keep climbing my way up to the top of this mountain

##22/08/2019
new lazy day no match for the last one, i need to make an actuacl schedule to regulate the way i do things in order to be more efficient in basically everything, i actually wana work on this

##23/08/2019
thanks to the lack of electricity courtesy of my country i ended up spending the whole day without studying nor coding.... it was very frustrating but it did helped me think about how could i possibbly solve this and i can't... so a remote work from home could be harder... i need to find a place to work/study/grow as a web developer i realize that i need to learn PHP beyond of just adding PHP to my tech list there is also the fact that i cannot just let myself be beaten by any tech, i choose this path on my own and on my own shall i triumph!!!

##24/08/2019
today's commit is in vscode but not by choice, my city, or probably state, is currently having electricity problems which means i either have no electricty to turn my laptop on or no internet to commit anything into my repos.... and yeah it sucks!

sounds bad?
and it is... i try to not let this get me down but the truth is that when you study with the help of the internet and suddenly is gone there is nothing you can do but to practice and is nice if it wasn't for whn i get stuck in which case i have to look online which also leave me nowhere... is not as half as bad as when there is no electricity moment in which i can't even practice, again, i try to not let this get me down the in reality it hits me really hard.... i can't stop thinking on why should i go through this and then i understand that YES it is bad but it has also helped me to realize how gratefull i should be over the things i have WHEN i have them something as small as a lighter is amazing sometimes...

##30/08/2019
This one is gonna be different... i got quite down, depress, sad... basically while i was with no internet i felt disconnected from the world and what quite even worse is the fact of me not being able to check how to solve my problems with the classes in javascript which i haven't check yet, something i've come to realize is the fact that i'm scared of both success and failure or maybe i'm scare of fail in my success it hasn't been easy to get to where i am right now and is not exactly high per say i don't want to give up, i refuse tto give up but is getting harder to keep moving... i'm making myself harder to move deal with this kind of things is more than difficult but i just need to make my big problem a bunch of little problems i can do it, is not that hard and once i've done it i know i will be able to move easier

##31/08/2019
RIP my cute little forest in github... i'm feeling lazy to do things lately, specially programming but i think is mainly cause whenever i get stuck i don't want to continue, probably cause i feel like i should already know how that works but truth is that i don't know how it does and that's okay i need to understand that not knowing how something works at first is okay, what's bad is not wanting to know how it does i need to stop being scared cause there is nothing to be affraid but to fear it self

##01/09/2019
New month, is already september so yay! this month i'll be 23 but that's meaningless what is important is that i challenge myself to get a job as a web developer before september 25 so i have 22 days left basically... time is running and i'm currently not really studying and i should i don't feel scared for not getting the job i'm determinated to get it but rather on how to keep it... i mean is suppose to be simple right? just work, do your best and fight any obstacle that comes your way... easy!

##03/09/2019
i haven't been constant on this journal but what i really wanna say today is that i realize that my phone number is kinda of unplug, it doesn't get calls a friend told me today that he couldn't get to call me and then showed me that in the moment he called thee was no tone.... this is actually quite worrying as it may be a reason why  don't get call for interviews and i say this with some optimism intentions it wouldn't be the worst that it was mainly because of that so... let's ty a new change
