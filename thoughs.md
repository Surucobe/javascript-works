# What's next? #
### 12/07/2019 ###
many thoughs fly into my mind about what should i next and how, my knowledge in javascript grows more and more as my hunger for them does

It's been a while since i decided to make a big change in my life and i actually put some work into it

Was it easy? 
Not in the begining, it seems like as soon as you start to progress with your projects you get more creative with excuses

What's going on now?
today i finish the first part of a very cool project which i came up with i didn't see a thing about it anywhere

Now what?
i'm looking foward new projects that challenge me to learn more so i stop walking little steps and start running into my adventure

Today i had my first peek into actual dinamic content, they way to make automatic content, content that updates automatically as soon as someone request it and it may change depending on who and when it is require

how did it went?
i'm still absorbing this and i won't be able to properly say i know how to do it till i implement it on my projects

the first question it's, how am i gonna do that?
well actually there is a very simple answer, i got an idea i wanna generate a dinamic list that changes as soon as the user puts some info into the array, i only saw how to with content that was already there but i don't think it changes that much maybe just on how they interact

today i worked really hard i must say, i worked with dinamic content generated by the user in my projected, the poke projected, i keep telling myself "i'm not going to do some kind of silly victory pose if this works" and then 2 seconds later after i test and see the succesfull result, there i am making a silly victory pose lol

how did it went?
it went really well, at first i struggle generating the html that would held my dinamic content as it was suppose to bring an image an some text but it only bring the image, after fixing the html i manage to bring both images and text with no problem all that is left is for me to learn how to make it go away or refresh

do i know how to do it? not yet, do i have an idea? a minor one, is it a good idea? hell no! but you know what? i get to have fun while doing so i feel closer to my goal 

## I'm done studying, it's time to learn ##
