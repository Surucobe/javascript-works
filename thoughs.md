# What's next? #
### 12/07/2019 
many thoughs fly into my mind about what should i next and how, my knowledge in javascript grows more and more as my hunger for them does

It's been a while since i decided to make a big change in my life and i actually put some work into it

Was it easy? 
Not in the begining, it seems like as soon as you start to progress with your projects you get more creative with excuses

What's going on now?
today i finish the first part of a very cool project which i came up with i didn't see a thing about it anywhere

Now what?
i'm looking foward new projects that challenge me to learn more so i stop walking little steps and start running into my adventure

### 13/07/2019 
Today i had my first peek into actual dinamic content, they way to make automatic content, content that updates automatically as soon as someone request it and it may change depending on who and when it is require

how did it went?
i'm still absorbing this and i won't be able to properly say i know how to do it till i implement it on my projects

the first question it's, how am i gonna do that?
well actually there is a very simple answer, i got an idea i wanna generate a dinamic list that changes as soon as the user puts some info into the array, i only saw how to with content that was already there but i don't think it changes that much maybe just on how they interact

### 14/07/2019 
today i worked really hard i must say, i worked with dinamic content generated by the user in my projected, the poke projected, i keep telling myself "i'm not going to do some kind of silly victory pose if this works" and then 2 seconds later after i test and see the succesfull result, there i am making a silly victory pose lol

how did it went?
it went really well, at first i struggle generating the html that would held my dinamic content as it was suppose to bring an image an some text but it only bring the image, after fixing the html i manage to bring both images and text with no problem all that is left is for me to learn how to make it go away or refresh

do i know how to do it? not yet, do i have an idea? a minor one, is it a good idea? hell no! but you know what? i get to have fun while doing so i feel closer to my goal

### 14/07/2019 
funny story, as i was working on the javscript file today i forgot that in order to work with an external api once the app is deployed i need to work on the cross origin for my app to work, i forgot to do that and i'm not sure how to do it just yet, so after a succesfull deploy of the web site with a fail app i went back to the code and seem that i delete something by mistake so my idea was, let me just go to my previous commit where everything is awesome! yeah....

What Happened?
well i was in a detached head of the commit and i forgot to see and keep working and ended up saving all the progress in there, yeah i know there is a way to move that commit but... i just remember that, in any case i had to add some of the changes i did to the master branch manually

Did i learn something?
yeah... the implementation of a hotfix branch is key for me to not loose my mind and keep workin, on a side note i learn how to remove the implemented html from javascript with more javascript! my app is starting to take shape

### 15/07/2019
i'm writing the 15/07/2019 log on the day after, 16/07, due to a internet problem from yesterday that basically leave me with no internet till 12:35 from today 16, lucky me i manage to work on my projects before this happened

What did i do?
i working on a replacement for the sweet alert library i was using on my app, creating my own modal which will make everything sweet alert was doing AND more as i'm planning on replacing the propmt i'm using to catch the user request , this part should be easy the, ironically, hard part is the visual part i wish to add, right now the modal remain with some static elements but son enough it will be completely independant of these

### 16/07/2019 
so.... the part i said was easy? yeah i don't wanna talk about that, let's just say i have a new respect on how prompt works, as i'm stil working on this new subject i learn that storing multiples answer in a single array to replace what's gonna be shown is a very comfortable practice, unlike what it looks like

what did i do?
not the propmt that what.... i keep making progress into a more dinamic app by aming to make a completely dinamic modal which will be basically empty, except for a button, till you hit a button i also learn you can work with multiple background, i've been thinking about storing all the string i have for javascript to build into a big array but i don't think is a good idea, at least not inside an array

### 17/07/2019 
Today i'm making this early, i usually write my progress at the end of the day before i go to sleep but today is different, i'm planning on going to sleep early as i'm currently sick and i need to take care of myself and my brilliant ideas, i believe is the first time i say that with no irony nor any sarcasm.... at least not too much

am i feeling ok?
not quite, beyond my sickness i'm worried about my laptop, it's not on it's best shape and i have no currency, money, tradeble chickens, or any kind of money i can use to buy a new one all i got is a goal of having a very good job that allows me to buy one some day

was there any progress today?
uhm.... yeah i made the error message of the modal completely dinamic, there is something else i wanna to implement still but idk how to do it just yet, give me some time and i did learn that you cannot get a dinamic id from an element but then again i'm still learning, idk how to explain this but i recently feel like a whole new world just open it's gates for me...

## 18/07/2019 ##
today i started to see dinamic forms which is interesting and changes the way i'm looking at how to keep building my app, it seems easier in a way, yeah i'm trying to avoid creating the popmt i know BUT i also need to practice this sort of things so....

today was short....
yeah i got unexpected company so i need to finish early today but i have no excuse for tomorrow

i'm feeling better by tthe wway!

### 19/07/2019 
today i start working with a new idea, instead of summoning a propmt into my app to take the users' input, work with an actual input printed in my html in order to well firstly try something new, working with a form in javascript, and making my app visual part on the website better by being able to work with an element i can customize.... NO, i'm not avoiding the propmt!

how did that go?
terrible i know squat about making form from jsvascript, i barely manage to get the input data in a const at the end of the day AND i can't help to feel fucking amazing for it! it was challenging it was new and at the end i manage to get my object in answer to my input and even tho i don't have this new branch incorporated and working on the master branch is exciting to try something new, i don't understand this new methods YET, but i will soon, give me an actual day to sit, read and practice i still need to improve some minor and some other major things, but my future projects will be gratefull i took my time learning

P.S Future me, if you are reading this and you are being an ass, remember that people is just scared of being judge they are scared of being nice to people and people not being nice to them, give them time

### 20/07/2019 
so today i kept working on the form and made it work! end of today's log!

what's that really all?
ok no but it's really all that i did, well i did learn that using a propmt in different from the input when it comes to getting the users input, you see, it seems that the propmt stores the value while the input just hold it as it is submit, is quite different giving me the awkward result of the modal showing up empty white while my code gets the information, javascript asynchronism, so in order to manage that a little better i decided to just tell the code to wait and it does work on the most part, i need to make the code to wait for the image to load before showing the modal but i think is time to move into the styles and maybe another project

### 21/07/2019
today i decided to chill and take a nice brake, play some cards, watch some anime, eat good and play with my dog, i did try checking some algorythm in freecodecamp cahllenge, it was fun and made think also started the first part of a new repo which will contain my ULTIMATE portfolio

why the caps?
i wanted to give like a big stounding sense, like saying "yup, this one is gonna be my greates project so far!"the reason why is cause my knowledge in javascript is better now, even if it's not completed yet, and also cause i need to keep moving i can't just stay studying and saying "yeah i'm learning" i need to put that knowledge into work, oh also i move my local repo somewhere else

## 22/07/2019
today i started working on my portfolio, i decided to put a pause on my poke app and start moving on with my protfolio whit a cool picture of a couple of hardworking stormtrooper

what happened?
there was a massive blackout in my country.... no energy till around 1 or 2 am maybe and then around 4 am light was off again, internet hasn't come back ever since and all i did was the side bar and the main page so yeah there is that

##23/07/2019
energy finally came back like 1 or two hours ago, it's 14:17pm at the time i write this down and while i work on my portfolio

why so early?
i don't know if there will be energy later... there's no warranty i won't spend another 12 hours with no energy so i wanted to be a little proactive and work on my projects... nope internet is still gone so i haven't been able to update my github, it only hurts the fact that my cute activity summary on github is gonna have a few gray squares but that's actually the least of my problems right? if you wonder how it feels like to be in the pitch dark for so long, it's like boxing blindfolded you are not even sure who are you fighting, how many are you fighting or if you are even fighting time even pass slower, huh!

i won't give up, it takes more than this to make me quit, actually there's nothing that can make me quit now!

##24/07/2019
give me a moment i was laughing....

better now?
is important to keep a healthy mind one that can be a flow of unlimited ideas and plans and what a better way to do that than laughing, after every lesson and sometimes while i code i put on some funny videos to have a nice laugh andit feel amazing! i mean my mouth hurts but for a good reason 

what about the projects?
i'm giving a rest to the main project i was working on till i get some new ideas to add and in the meanwhile i started working on my portfolio, this will be my best work yet, the goal is to make an incredible personal website aiming to show anyone who enters in this one who am i and what can he expect from me if he hires me, i'm moving on my projects but still need to get back to some other stuff, i'm glad i have many things to do!

##25/07/2019
apparently i kinda miss a day, i've been coding every single day, some less than other, but every day but i guess that in this madness i'm living in i miss a day due to energy problems

how you doing?
i'm going well, today i keep working to imrpove my app making sure that once an object is already inside of an array a second object won't go inside the problem may be the fact that i used a second array to evaluate this, the second option would be to evaluate a single array and work on a function to take out the id of those objects to tranforms them into objects again soon in the app but sounds like lots more of code and making new petitions and sounds longer and not quite efficience, may look for a different solution soon tho, a new idea pop into my head, creat the ultimate catalog with ALL the pokemons and IT IS madness but i like how it sounds

##26/07/2019
today was an interesting day, i improve my app and check some new things on my classes i feel glad to understand everything i do, and even when i get a little lost i can just start reading what i'm doing

what's next now?
many ideas and thoughs run through my head wildly, idk how to make most of them and i'm not sure how to make the other but i yet but i know is possible and i just need some time, i've been thinking about trying the 100 days of code challenge again, i mean i'm already on it on my own but this time i would like to finish this

##27/07/2019
today i had a very productive day, i started a new class in OOP, oriented object programming i know the name better in spanish, with the goal of understanding objects and classes a little bit better and a new though pop into my head i feel like my life has change a lot in these last few weeks i've made some major changes and i'm looking forward to keep making more and more changes, i'm still looking in my ultimate goal but i feel like i'm stuck...

why you feel stuck?
well when i first start programming, making cool stuff, making this kind of things that i've never done before in my life i feel so different, like if i was a new person a different one but this feeling lasted little i can still make new a cool stuff and every day i learn more and more but i feel like i'm stuck with new trick under the same categories i wanna keep moving forwards i want new challenges and for that i most keep practicing and learning but then the question pops into my head, how do i get to the thngs i wanna do, where do i find them but i think there is right answer i just need to keep walking and hope to find all those answers on my own... yeah

##28/07/2019
today was a very normal day, i decided to take an actual rest, no classes, no reading about classes, i basically slept eat and eatch some videos

what's that really all?
well i also work on my projects and may or may not look at them again before i go to sleep, i may also look for a few things about js before going to sleep i have a few ideas in my head that idk how to execute just yet but that i'm sure i will execute and are gonna be great, today i linked working on my portfolio more than i like to work on my other projects

##29/07/2019
I spend most of the day trying to make my repo in github works, the one that works with an api, but i couldn't make it worh it to me because me but it seems that github has is own rules about this kind of things

long day?
i guess you could say that, i fall asleep and ended up writing this the day after i made a huge mess with my personal things and my studies, i try to make both things happened and ended up doing none i need to set what i'm doing better, stick to one things after the other, i wanna finish my projects which will only be finish if i keep working on it and i wanna keep working on my portfolio but i need to stop being scared from moving on for this

##30/07/2019
finally manage to work with the localstorage now the next step is working with the elements i creat at the moment so that part will be intereting, i already have an idea

that's great!
it is!!! i wanna keepp working on new thing, such as the portfolio what i already said a new project and how to make it work in this repo or maybe somewhere else, the idea is to maybe show my work!

##31/07/2019
spend the entire day on a way to interact with the elements i was printing on my code, it was hard and it makes me realize that i still have a long way to go, but i'm enjoying it, i still do small and funny celebration stance whenever i achieve something in my code, i can't help it

you moving?
maybe... i've decided to give 100 days of codes a second chance, well rather look for a second chance on a 100 days of code i didn't finish that challenge and i'm no coward, i'm done running and have no interested in doing so ever again so here i am once again but stronger this time

##01/08/2019
quick though in a couple of week it wil be a month since i started doing this log, is nice, i once heard that to make something an habit you need to repeat it every day for a month, i found myself in piece doing this,i like to share my ideas with... me lol and next month will be my birthday

new plans?
well before my birthday arrives i would like to get a nice paid job as a fronted developer so i can actually celebrate or who knows maybe even buy a phone! that would be very sweet to FINALLY have a phone means i would get to talk with my friends again

what about coding?
i feel stuck but at the same time i feel like i'm not, i'm looking for way to implement new stuff on my app, what i'm doing it may be advanced and idk how to do it but i like it, i'm trying to either make an element appear every time i place the mouse on certain areas or to make an element be created at the moment i place the mouse on those areas

##02/08/2019
today i didn't code that much, i solve some freecodecamp problems and saw some classes on webpack and OOP it was nice

out of ideas?
not really i still have many i just don't know how to plasm them into the web i also wanna start studying for interviews and want to study react.js there is a lot of things i want to study but before i do that i also wanna work on my concentration

##03/08/2019
today was normal, i'm still coding as i write this i'm gonna work on my portfolio but i didn't study that much, i'm currently studying objects so i can understand js objects a little bit better

objects huh?
yeah i need to learn and dominate objects i cannot let myself get stuck can i? besides if i learn objects things will have a new and different perspective that i'm looking forward, also today i sent my cv to a company looking for a web developer idk if i will get it but i feel like i'm already making changes is the first time i apply for a company as a web developer! this is exciting

##04/08/2019
today i'm making this one form my visual studio code idk why i just felt like doing so, thse ays have been rough i don't feel that motivated, i must be doing something wrong, ideas are still flying by but other things seem to be getting me down as i type this  feel like crying even tho i have no reasons... well maybe i do but crying won't fix a damn thing

is it affecting your code?
maybe, again i have no idea about this cause... maybe i just need to talk to people, ever since i lost my phone y feel like i lost my friends, i can still talk to them but not like before, they are no longer one text away from me i can now notice the distance between us, today i'm not talking about code but not every day has to be about it yea i'll be good once i work over this things
